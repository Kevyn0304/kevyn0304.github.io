            My childhood was a little complicated. I was born in Las Vegas, Nevada on March 4th, 2002.
            I went to preschool and first grade there. Then I moved to Mexicali, Baja California, Mexico,
            because my parents needed to sort some things out. I spent 3 years there, experiencing what
            primary school was like outside of the US. Then my family returned to Las Vegas, where I finished
            elementary school and started middle school. However, my parents were deported during winter break
            of 7th grade. From here on out, I lived in Mexicali, but crossed the border every day by foot to
            finish my education in Calexico, California, a little border town in the Imperial Valley, 2 hours
            East of San Diego. Here I completed middle school and high school. I then got admitted into 
            UC Berkeley's College of Engineering to study Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS).

            I've been recently discovering what things I like. I love the cyberpunk aesthetic, and dystopian
            stories. I also really appreciate good cinematography, like in movies such as Inception, The Great
            Budapest Hotel,
